\begin{abstract}

The Chinese room argument advanced by Searle has been influencing the strong AI literature for decades. We define strong AI and general AI, distinguishing the two concepts. We briefly describe Searle's ideas, focusing on the Chinese room thought experiment. We analyze and build upon some of the critiques advanced by other researchers in the strong AI community. We find the Chinese room argument to be flawed when confronted with the concept of simulation and the ideas of functionalism, suggesting that there is still no good reason to believe that a computer cannot attain consciousness.
